# AlarmClock

This is a simple Java-based alarm clock application.  
The user enters a desired alarm time, and the program continuously checks the current system time.  
When both times match, the alarm sound is played.

# Features
- Takes input for alarm time (HH:mm:ss)
- Compares current time with user-input time
- Plays a sound when the alarm triggers

## How to Run
Run the Java file in any IDE (IntelliJ, Eclipse, VS Code) after adding your audio file to the project folder.
